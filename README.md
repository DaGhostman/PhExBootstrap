# PhExBootstrap
__PHP Expressive Bootstrap__ is a bootstrap application for building
zend-expressive applications in a modular way. By default ships with
FastRoute as router and Twig as template engine.

## Installation
Requires `php >= 5.5`

 - Composer

In an empty directory with nothing more than your application
`composer.json` file. Run `composer create-project ddimitrov/pxb .`
(mind the trailing dot) in the project directory, this will run
`git clone` on the project and install all of its dependencies.

 - Manual

Just download a archive from GitHub and extract into your project
directory, but you will still need to use composer to fetch all
dependencies.
